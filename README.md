> For better a experience(step through code), run via VSCode's **JavaScript Debug** terminal or similar.
>
> In the _export function_ of each script, there is an area wrapped in the Performance Web API that can be used to capture execution time of one or more relevant elements.
>
> This repo will always be a **WIP** (personal playground, notepad, idea palette, etc.), therefore, there may be missing relevant information, concepts and or examples.
